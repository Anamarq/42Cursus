# 42 Cursus Project Recap

## Libft
`libft` involves recreating or reinterpreting certain functions from the standard C library. The project starts with basic functions and progressively adds more complex ones with additional functionalities.

## ft_printf
The `ft_printf` project recreates the well-known `printf` function, utilizing variadic arguments to handle a variable number of input parameters.

## get_next_line
The `get_next_line` function is designed for reading files. It allows you to retrieve a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor. Subsequent calls to the function with the same file retrieve the next line. This project focuses on efficient memory allocation, ensuring proper freeing and allocation to prevent memory leaks.

## pipex
`pipex` is a project that recreates, in C, the way two commands are piped together via the `|` operator in the shell.
